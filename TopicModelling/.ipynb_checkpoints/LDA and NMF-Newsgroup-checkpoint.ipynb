William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at ColoradoState University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantichurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but aboveaverage for the decade.   The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of thelast six hurricane seasons. Those years brought just two to fivehurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.   The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its mostactive period usually begins Aug. 1.   Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annualhurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his firstformal 1988 forecast in late May. He issued an early ``outlook''Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference.   ``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which doesform in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the averagehurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,''Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.   But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around theequator and winds for ``El Nino'' periods, when eastern Pacificwaters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of whenor where a hurricane might form.   Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterlywinds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino'' period.   Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actuallyoccurred. His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and heoriginally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figureto seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985. In 1984, when therewere five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.   Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantichurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said. He said the droughthas robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start theirescalation into hurricanes.   That pattern eventually will change, he said, ``but it isimpossible to say when this shift will occur.''   Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conferencestressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during thelull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.\",\n",

Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty. The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform.    If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.

His Domestic Policy Council has drafted a blueprint. It would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs. Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform. The president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action.

This suggests that the Democrats aren\\'t as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are.    There is a reason for this. The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy.

The president should take up his case for reform directly with the American people. With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo.
